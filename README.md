# configuration-files
Tracking of various configuration files. Included in this repository:

.bash_profile - profile when loading bash. Used with iterm2 and OSX

.emacs_init.el - emacs init file, stolen primarily from somewhere on the vast internet. Could use some significant cleanup

tjb.mplstyle - simple stylesheet for matplotlib. Base was borrowed from  _Bayesian Methods for Hackers_, and developed on top of that
